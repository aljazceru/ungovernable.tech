# Decentralized Platforms

Fully decentralized platforms that enable building applications without reliance on centralized infrastructure or big tech.

## Implementations

### Freenet
[freenet-core](https://github.com/freenet/freenet-core) - The internet as it should be—fully decentralized. Freenet is a peer-to-peer network that transforms users' computers into a resilient, distributed platform where anyone can build decentralized services. Every peer contributes to a fault-tolerant collective ensuring services are always available. Apps built on Freenet are fully interoperable by default and can be accessed through any browser just like the web. Built with Rust.

### Tangle Blueprint SDK  
[tangle-network/blueprint](https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint) - A comprehensive toolkit for building, deploying, and managing blueprints on the Tangle Network. Blueprints turn complex on-chain and off-chain infrastructure into reproducible, deployable units of logic—Infrastructure-as-Code for crypto systems. The SDK unifies job orchestration, P2P networking, cryptographic primitives, and EVM/EigenLayer integrations. Build anything from oracles and MPC networks to agent-based AI services or zk-proof markets.
