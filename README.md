Welcome to Ungovernable Tech. This started as a landing page for [my](https://nostr.at/aljaz@nostr.si) notes about research I was doing during the [Sovereing Engineering Cohort](https://sovereignengineering.io/) but I've decided to make it more structured and make it a bookmark page for all my research into freedom enabling technology.  Most topics are far from comprehensively covered but I'm slowly adding resources to it. 

Categories below are none-exhaustive list of building blocks for a better, more decentralized internet that enables freedom from survaillance capitalism and governmental overreach. It focuses on topics I think don't get enough attention nowaday and skips the ones with plenty like bitcoin and artificial intelligence.


## [Confidential Computing](./ConfidentialComputing.md)
Confidential computing enables a whole new paradigm. On one hand it removes a lot of the trust requirements needed while at the same time enablesm cheaper infrastructure. 

## [Decentralized  DNS](./DecentralizedDNS.md)
We are building all kinds of cool decentralized systems but keep forgetting that majority of them still relay on DNS which is very prone to seizure and manipulation. 

## [Decentralized compute](./DecentralizedCompute.md)
Most people have spare compute and bandwidth, at least the ones with desktop PCs and routers. Cryptography can remove the issues with trust models and makes every computer plugged into internet and power a productive asset.

## [Full Homomophic Encryption](./FullHomomorphicEncryption.md)
In a world where your private information is not for sale and your attention is not the product data is a liability not an asset. FHE can enable privacy preserving solutions for many/most database applications. 

## [Private Information Retrieval](./PrivateInformationRetrieval.md)
Fighting tyranny with math. Every company or individual is one court order away from needing to decide how long they are willing to spend behind bars for not sharing the data with the government. Designing systems that are default private and cryptographically sound makes sure you have nothing to share with them.
